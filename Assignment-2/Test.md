### 7. Data Collection and Preprocessing
 ### 7.1 Data Sources
The dataset used for the salary prediction model is sourced from publicly available job market data, company salary reports, and online job portals. Key attributes include:
- Years of Experience
- Education Level
- Job Title
- Location
- Industry
- Skills

### 7.2 Data Cleaning
Data cleaning involves handling missing values, correcting inconsistencies, and normalizing data. Steps taken include:
- Imputing missing values using median/mode
- Standardizing job titles
- Normalizing salary data to a common currency and scale. 

### 7.3 Data Transformation
Transformations applied to the dataset include:
- Encoding categorical variables (e.g., job titles, education levels)
- Feature scaling (e.g., normalizing years of experience)
- Creating new features (e.g., interaction terms between education level and job role. 

### 8. Model Selection and Training 
### 8.1 Model Selection
Several machine learning models were considered, including:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting Machines
- Neural Network

### 8.2 Training Process
The training process involves:
- Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
- Hyperparameter tuning using grid search and cross-validation
- Training the final model on the combined training and validation sets.
 
### 9. Model Deployment 
### 9.1 Deployment Strategy
The model is deployed as a RESTful API, allowing integration with various applications and platforms. The deployment stack includes:
- Flask/Django for the API framework
- Docker for containerization
